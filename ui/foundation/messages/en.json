As such, user-facing features are very limited. The coming testnet-2 (expected in June/July) will add our flagship product, the Dango DEX. Then, testnet-3 (August/September) will add margin trading.\n\nFor now, you can sign up, open subaccounts, and transfer tokens, that’s it. Upon your first login, you will receive some fake tokens (fake BTC, fake ETH, ...) to play with.\n\nMake sure to complete the Galxe quests[ADD LINK] and mint your limited time NFT!\n\ng🍡"
