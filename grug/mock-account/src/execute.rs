///
/// - `hash` is a hash function; this account implementation uses SHA2-256;
/// - `msgs` is the list of messages in the transaction;
/// - `sender` is a 32 bytes address of the sender;
/// - `chain_id` is the chain ID in UTF-8 encoding;
/// - `sequence` is the sender account's sequence in 32-bit big endian encoding.
///
/// Chain ID and sequence are included in the sign bytes, as they are necessary
/// for preventing replat attacks (e.g. user signs a transaction for chain A;
/// attacker uses the signature to broadcast another transaction on chain B.)
