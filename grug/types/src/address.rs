/// An account address.
///
/// In Grug, addresses are of 20-byte length, in Hex encoding and the `0x` prefix.
/// In comparison, in the "vanilla" CosmWasm, addresses are either 20- or 32-byte,
/// in Bech32 encoding. The last 6 ASCII characters are the checksum.
///
/// In CosmWasm, when addresses are deserialized from JSON, no validation is
/// performed. An attacker can put a string that is not a valid address in a
/// message, and this would be deserialized into an `cosmwasm_std::Addr` without
/// error. Therefore, in CosmWasm, it is recommended to deserialize addresses
/// into `String`s first, then call `deps.api.addr_validate` to validate them.
/// This can be sometimes very cumbersome. It may be necessary to define two
/// versions of the same type, one "unchecked" version with `String`s, one
/// "checked" version with `Addr`s.
///
/// In Grug, addresses are validated during deserialization. If deserialization
/// doesn't throw an error, you can be sure the address is valid. Therefore it
/// is safe to use `Addr`s in JSON messages.
