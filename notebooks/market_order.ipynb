    "# Market order execution\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, let's consider in the BTC-USD pair, executing a series BUY market order against the SELL side of the resting orderbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(p_i, A_i)$: a SELL limit order, where $p_i$ is the price (as the units of USD that's equal in value as 1 unit of BTC); $A_i$ is the order's size (as units of BTC).\n",
    "- $\\{ (p_i, A_i) \\mid i = 1, 2, \\dots, N \\}$: the SELL side of the resting orderbook, sorted by price-time priority. Specifically, $p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq p_3 \\leq \\dots \\leq p_N$.\n",
    "- $(B_j, s_j)$: a BUY market order, where $B_j$ is the budget (as units of USD); $s_j$ is the maximum slippage (defined below).\n",
    "- $\\{ (B_j, s_j) \\mid j = 1, 2, \\dots, M \\}$: the series of BUY market orders, sorted by priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum slippage works as follows: suppose the best ask price at the time of executing market order $(B_j, s_j)$ is $p_{\\mathrm{best}}$, the market order's _average execution price_ must not be worse than $p_{\\mathrm{max}} = (1 + s_j) p_{\\mathrm{best}}$. Note it's possible that the market order is executed against a limit order whose limit price $p_i > p_{\\mathrm{max}}$, as long as the _average_ price over all limit order consumed is no greater than $p_{\\mathrm{max}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the onchain smart contract, $A_i$ and $B_j$ are integers, denoted in the minimum indivisible units of BTC and USD, respectively. However, here for simplicity, we use floating point numbers for all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is a function that takes the inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\{ (p_i, A_i) \\mid i = 1, 2, \\dots, N \\}$\n",
    "- $\\{ (B_j, s_j) \\mid j = 1, 2, \\dots, M \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each market order,\n",
    "  - the amount of USD sold;\n",
    "  - the amount of BTC bought.\n",
    "- For each limit order consumed,\n",
    "  - the amount of BTC sold;\n",
    "  - the amount of USD bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:"
