/// later) and streams them, in strictly ascending height order, to the
/// `RemoteBlockSource` that owns it.
///
/// A fetcher does **bounded** backfill: it fetches one contiguous height
/// range and then terminates. The `RemoteBlockSource` invokes it once per gap
/// it needs to fill — see `design/remote-block-source.md`. The fetcher knows
/// nothing about where blocks are stored; storing is the source's job.
///
/// **The consumer validates, not trusts.** A fetcher *should* emit exactly the
/// ascending, contiguous range `[from, to]`, but the owning source does not
/// assume it: it checks each block's height against the one it expects, and
/// treats a mismatch — or a stream that ends ([`FetchStream::recv`] returns
/// `None`) before `to` is delivered — as a failure, never as "range complete".
/// This keeps a misbehaving backend (a wrong or stale block) or a dead task
/// from silently corrupting the store or leaving a hole, and it holds
/// uniformly across every fetcher impl. The fetcher therefore carries no
/// self-validation.
