//! Metric names + descriptions for the block source.
//!
//! Names follow the `indexer_historical_*` flat-snake_case convention; the
//! RocksDB-internals gauges (emitted from [`store::disk`](crate::remote)) instead
//! reuse the node's `rocksdb_*` names verbatim, so the dango RocksDB Grafana
//! dashboard works against this service's `/metrics` unchanged. See
//! `design/observability.md`.
//!
//! [`init_metrics`] is always present (a no-op without the `metrics` feature) and
//! is called once at boot by the cli, alongside the other crates' init.

// The name constants are referenced only from `#[cfg(feature = "metrics")]`
// blocks, so a metrics-off build sees them as unused — expected, not a defect.
