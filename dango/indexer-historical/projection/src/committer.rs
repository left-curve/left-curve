/// One instance is shared by all projection loops. The cursor table —
/// `projection_cursors (id, height)` in the indexer-owned Postgres — is
/// the single source of truth for every projection's progress.
///
/// The contract (see `DESIGN.md` § Commit protocol):
///
/// 1. [`cursor`] returns the last height whose [`commit`] completed for
///    this projection id; the loop resumes from the next height.
/// 2. [`commit`] flushes the context's ClickHouse buffer and awaits its
///    acknowledgement FIRST, and only then commits the Postgres
///    transaction carrying the domain writes together with the cursor
///    update. Reversing the order can leave the cursor ahead of
///    ClickHouse after a crash — a permanent, unrecoverable hole. The
///    protocol order only ever causes a replay, which the deduplication
///    token absorbs.
