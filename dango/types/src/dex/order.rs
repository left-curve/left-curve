/// Numerical identifier of an order (limit or market).
///
/// ## Notes
///
/// ### Storage layout
///
/// For SELL orders, we count order IDs from 0 up; for BUY orders, from
/// `u64::MAX` down.
///
/// The reason for this, is we need orders to be sorted by **price-time priority**
/// in the contract's storage. Meaning, orders with the better prices come first;
/// for those with the same price, the older ones come first. We achieve this by
/// using the following storage key for orders:
///
/// ```plain
/// direction | price | order_id
/// ```
///
/// - For bids, we iterate all orders prefixed with `Direction::Bid`, _descendingly_.
/// - For asks, we iterate all orders prefixed with `Direction::Ask`, _ascendingly_.
///
/// In each case, price-time priority is respected.
///
/// See `dango_dex::state::OrderKey` for details.
///
/// Note that this assumes `order_id` never exceeds `u64::MAX / 2`, which is a
/// safe assumption. If we accept 1 million orders per second, it would take
/// ~300,000 years to reach `u64::MAX / 2`.
///
/// ### Serialization
///
/// JSON uses IEEE-754 64-bit floating point numbers to represent numbers, which
/// can only represent integers up to `2^53 - 1` without losing precision. For
/// example,
///
/// ```javascript
/// JSON.stringify({ number: 9007199254740993 })
/// ```
///
/// returns:
///
/// ```json
/// '{"number":9007199254740992}'
/// ```
///
/// The value is off by 1, because `9007199254740993` is bigger than `2^53 - 1`
/// and thus can't be represented without losing precision.
///
/// Since order IDs for bids are counted from top down, they necessarily exceed
/// `2^53 - 1`. To accurately represent these order IDs, instead of `u64`, we
/// use `grug::Uint64`, which is serialized as JSON strings.
