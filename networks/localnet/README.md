# Localnet

Start a local network for development purpose with [Dango](../../dango/cli/) execution node, [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) consensus, indexer with PostgreSQL backend, and a GraphQL endpoint.

This uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so no need to configure any dependency on your computer, such as Rust, Go, or Postgres client.

Genesis state and configuration files are found under [`./configs/`](./configs/) which you're free to modify.

Data generated by the localnet are placed under `./data/`. If you feel like starting a new localnet from scratch, simply delete this folder.

To start the localnet:

```bash
just start
```

To stop it, simply do CTRL+C.
