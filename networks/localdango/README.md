# LocalDango

A portable local Dango network for development purpose, with full execution and consensus, indexer with PostgreSQL backend, and a GraphQL endpoint.

This uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), so no need to configure any dependency on your computer, such as Rust, Go, or Postgres.

Genesis state and configuration files are found under [`./configs/`](./configs/) which you're free to modify.

Data generated by LocalDango are placed under `./data/`. If you feel like starting a new instance from scratch, simply delete this folder.

To start LocalDango:

```bash
just start
```

To stop it, simply do CTRL+C.

**NOTE**: A CometBFT consensus private key is found at [`./configs/cometbft/priv_validator_key.json`](./configs/cometbft/config/priv_validator_key.json). This key is only intended for use in LocalDango. Do not reuse it for any other purpose.
